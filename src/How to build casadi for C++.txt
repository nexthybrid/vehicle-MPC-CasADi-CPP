See the installation guide at:
https://casadi.sourceforge.net/api/html/d3/def/chapter2.html

For the casadi core, there are no need for dependencies, so the environment variable step can be skipped.

For the 'cmake ..' step, if the OS is Windows, you need to add the command line arguments:
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
What it does is that, instead of the default behavior (building for Visual Studio solutions), cmake will create
makefiles like it does in Unix-based system.
