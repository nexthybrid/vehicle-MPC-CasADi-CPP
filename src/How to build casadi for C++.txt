Apparently, building from source in Windows is challenging. Buidling in Ubuntu is easier.

=================Scattered Information on building tips===============

Prerequisites:

1. !!! Download this file from the link, and place it in the casadi/build folder in the coming steps
https://github.com/casadi/casadi/blob/develop/cmake/FindCASADI.cmake
(The issue comes from this following thread
https://groups.google.com/g/casadi-users/c/J97bu3SxzlA/m/yXgtwIGYFAAJ)

2. Make sure cmake, make are up-to-date. For Windows, use this thread to install make.

Build CasADi:

See the installation guide at:
https://casadi.sourceforge.net/api/html/d3/def/chapter2.html

For the casadi core, there are no need for dependencies, so the environment variable step can be skipped.

For the 'cmake ..' step, if the OS is Windows, you need to add the command line arguments:
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
What it does is that, instead of the default behavior (building for Visual Studio solutions), cmake will create
makefiles like it does in Unix-based system.
