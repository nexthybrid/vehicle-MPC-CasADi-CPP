1. Open Visual Studio and create a new C++ project or open an existing one.

2. In Solution Explorer, right-click on your project and select Properties.

3. In the Properties window, navigate to Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General.

4. In Additional Include Directories, add the path to the CasADi include directory, for example: C:\CasADi\include.

5. Save the changes and build the project.

Dear Pablo,

We do not currently ship Visual-Studio compatible libraries.
All our official binaries are prepared with MinGW.

Your best bet is to build CasADi yourself using Visual Studio.

Best regards,
